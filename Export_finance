Export Finance Study Guide
- The exporter may need pre-financing and protection against variations of rates of exchange of foreign currencies. 
The importer may need financing and protection against variation of rates of exchange of foreign currencies.
- If the importer needs a long-term financing to finance imported capital goods, it may consider international banks Export Credits, Commercial Loans or Development Loans.
- Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) were created to support national exports and they offer solutions to cover most of the financial tools requested by an export contract (Export Credits but also technical guarantees, pre-financing, short-term credit risks, etc.).
- The two forms of Export Credits are the Buyer’s Credit and the Supplier’s Credit.
- Public stakeholders involved in Export Finance are the ECAs themselves, but also providers of funding or tools to grant fixed rates (CIRR).
- The extension of an export credit also involves the exporter, the importer and the banks, as well as, in some cases, other providers of funds like capital markets.
- It is useful to prepare detailed financial offers which include a description of the main terms.
- The pre-requirements of an offer are a preliminary review of the project and its stakeholders as well as of the capacity of the ECA to intervene. The preliminary term-sheet includes indicative amount, duration, fees and interest rate, envisaged security package and main CPs (including confirmation of the public supports).
- The export credit can finance up to 85% of the underlying contract (including local content up to 30% of the export contract value), ECA premiums, and capitalized interest during the construction period.
- Adding securities not requested by an ECA is not recommended (execution and documentation risks).
- Non-OECD ECAs will become more important and ECAs are developing other products than regulated Export Credits.
- Development financial institutions are critical in some difficult countries. They can provide subsidized support for public projects and offer loans with large durations.
- Development Finance often focuses on the development of the country of the borrower (especially MDBs), while the ECAs focus on the support of the exporter.
- Traditional MDBs benefit from a Preferred Creditor Status, accordingly their loans are reimbursed before any other loan.
- Development Finance may have cumbersome processes (impact studies, tenders, etc.) with a focus on prices
