- The Asset Conversion Cycle is the time it takes for a company to purchase raw materials, convert those materials into finished goods, sell them and receive the payment in return.
- There are 3 major outputs as a result of the Operating Cycle activity: Accounts Payables, Inventory and Accounts Receivables.
- The three drivers of the Cash Conversion Cycle are: Accounts Payables (created by the procurement of raw material, components or any type of services), Inventory (created by the procurement of raw material and components) and the Accounts Receivables (created by the
sale of finished goods or services).
- Working Capital is the measure of a company’s liquidity, efficiency, and short-term financial health and has usually a time horizon of 360 days (one year).
- The drivers of Working Capital are the Cash Conversion Cycle (Accounts Payables, Inventory, and Accounts Receivables), Cash, Debt and any other short-term (up to one year) financial obligations or sources of income.
- The main factors impacting Working Capital include: Inventory Management (DIO), Sales Management (DSO), and Suppliers Management (DPO).
- Working Capital is generally calculated as short-term assets minus short-term liabilities or current assets minus current liabilities.
- The Cash Conversion Cycle is calculated as DSO + DIO – DPO.
- The quick ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures the ability of a company to pay its current liabilities when they become due with only liquid assets. It is calculated as Current Assets - Inventories / Current Liabilities.
- Letters of Credit, Guarantees, the BPO, Standby LCs and Documentary Collections are mainly settlement and risk mitigation instruments and as such do not impact any of the ratios of the CCC.
- Working Capital can be influenced by many factors. In order to have maximum impact, companies do usually focus their attention on 4 main areas: Commercial Terms, Process optimisation, Compliance and Monitoring, Management and Culture.
- These 4 key areas will drive action plans in either one or all or any combination of the
following actions:
  - reduce Inventory
  - increase Days Payments Outstanding
  - move inventory off books
  - shorten Days Sales Outstanding more effectively use short-term financing
  - more effectively invest cash short-term
