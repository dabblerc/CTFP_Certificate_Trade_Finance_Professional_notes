Supply Chain Finance Study Guide
- Physical supply chains involve several links including raw material producer, manufacturer, distributor and retailer. There are often multiple tiers of suppliers to a manufacturer.
- Progress along the supply chain can be described as a series of events and each has a financial
consequence:
  - Risk – exposure or mitigation
  - Funding – finance requirement or liquidity increase
  - Payment flow – funds received or funds paid away.
- SMEs are typically driven by the need for liquidity.
- MMCs are typically driven by working capital efficiency.
- The hierarchy of supply chain finance products and the product definitions themselves are set out in first edition of ‘Standard Definitions for Techniques of Supply Chain Finance’ published by the ICC in April 2016.
- Supply chain finance products are sub-divided into two broad types:
- 1) Receivables Purchase: Receivables Discounting, Forfaiting, Factoring, and Payables Finance
- 2) Loan/Advance Based: Loan/Advance against Receivables or Inventory, Distributor Finance, and Pre-shipment Finance
- The choice of product(s) will depend on the client’s perspective (buyer or seller) and their needs and priorities (drivers).
- The choice of supply chain finance product(s) will depend heavily on the client drivers. Typical drivers include: Cash flow acceleration, Risk mitigation, Increased debt capacity, Reduced finance cost, Reduces COGS, Reduced DSO, Increased DPO, Efficiency gains, Enhanced supply
chain stability, Corporate social responsibility, Enhanced competitiveness, and Reduced DIO
- The majority of supply chain finance products today focus on the post-invoice stages of the physical supply chain.
- Digitalisation may be summarised as: replacing information written on paper documents with data held in electronic records, the use of data held in electronic records to make decisions and to drive processes with minimal, if any, human intervention, the capture of data from processes and activities to populate electronic records automatically, and electronic records with legal equivalence to paper documents
